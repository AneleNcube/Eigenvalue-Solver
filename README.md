# Physics-Informed Machine Learning for QNMs
Inspired by the PINNs (see https://github.com/lululxvi/deepxde) and Eigenvalue Solvers (see https://github.com/henry1jin/eigeNN), the code contained here computes black hole QNMs by employing deep neural networks with physics constraints embedded in the loss function.
